# Measurements and Verification Scripts

In this folder are contained the script that can be used to determine the length of the internal active cables of a single Tensegrity module. Please refere to script `performs_measurements.sh` for more information and the order of execution of each script.

In addition to the previous script, two more programs are provided:

- to verify that observed fitness is correct (noiseless case) or in general that it is possible to achieve similar values
- to compute and plot the fitness distribution for each robot configuration in the feature space (number of modules and stiffness values)
